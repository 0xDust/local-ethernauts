# Vault

- Pass this challenge by unlocking the vault, on this challenge you'll need to code on `VaultHelper.ts` to get the private data!

# Hints

- First, understand how ETH stores all state, even state declared as private
- Second, find a way to access the private variable "password" using the ethers.js library
- Finally, use the password to unlock the vault!

- Note: You can pass Vault's test without using an AttackingVault.sol file, so we have removed it for you
